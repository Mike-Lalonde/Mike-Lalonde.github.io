This portfolio is designed to be **recruiter-friendly** and **engineering-forward**:

- Fast loading static site (GitHub Pages)
- Resume PDFs served directly (reliable links)
- Case studies that show *how I think*
- Notebooks hosted as HTML exports (clean reading)
- A future AI assistant with a proper architecture boundary

Next up: add 2–3 project case studies with screenshots and outcomes.
